# Introduction to Computer Vision

This repository contains an **unofficial** python version of the Matlab quizzes available at GT's / Udacity's Introduction to Computer Vision.

The code available was implemented to closely mimic the results shown in each quiz.

## Available quizzes (so far):

* 2A-L1
* 2A-L2
* 2A-L3
* 2A-L4
* 2A-L6

I am still working on the remaining lectures. If there is a quiz missing in the existing sections, open a ticket and I will work on it as soon as possible.
